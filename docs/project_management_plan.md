**Project Quality Management**

**Quality Management Plan**

Project quality is defined as the degree to which the project deliverables  meet the requirements.  A  **Quality Management Plan**  is the component of the Project Management Plan which ensures that the requirements are met.

A good quality management plan contains the following 4 parts.

1. Quality Standards
2. Quality Assurance
3. Quality Control
4. Quality Inspection

**Quality Metrics:**

1. Fixed Defects Percentage = (Defects Fixed / Total Defects Reported) \* 100
2. Failed Test Cases Percentage = (Number of Failed Tests / Total number of tests executed) \* 100
3. Accepted Defects Percentage = (Defects Accepted as valid by team / Total defects reported) \*100
4. Passed Test Cases Percentage = (Number of Passed Tests / Total number of tests executed) \* 100
5. Executed Tests or Test Execution Coverage Percentage = (Number of tests run / Total number of tests to be run) \*100
6. Requirements Coverage = (Number of requirements covered / Total number of requirements) \*100
7. Number of bugs per test = Total number of defects / Total number of tests
8. Test design efficiency = Number of tests designed / Total time

**Quality Roles and Responsibilities:**



| **Name** | **Role** | **Quality Responsibility** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Sai Sri Lakshmi Vancha | Web Developer | Quality Approver |
| Gopi Amara | UI developer | Quality Assurance |
| Mallikarjuna Bodepudi  | Team Lead | Quality Auditor |
| Sai Sri Lakshmi Vancha | Project Manager | Quality Monitoring |



| **S No** | **Defect Level** | **Defect Name** | **Measurements** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | High-Level Defects | Wrong Estimation, Not allocating work to an ideal individual, Planning error | Project estimation should be proficient more suitably and sufficient time should be given to evaluate the project. Project Manager should have a better than average data of the partners and their abilities and dole out work in like way.Care must be taken in the arranging stage, so that later shocks are evaded. |
| 2 | Mid-level Defects | Bugs, Integration issues | Bugs are standard in any project so suitable testing and quality affirmation should be actualized.  Exactly when modules are united together and attempted on a whole a couple issues may develop so the testing gathering should have enough learning of the extensive number of modules |
| 3 | Low-level Defects | Screen Resolution, Hard-disk specifications | Screen resolution of the PCs won&#39;t not be awesome which may not be a tremendous issue but instead work should be conceivable better if it is as per the particulars |

**Project Resources Management**

**Resource Management Plan**



The Resource Management Plan is to organize and lead the project team as well as other resources

**Project Risk Management**

**Risk Management Plan**

1. **Methodology:**

We will recheck every possible deliverable before reporting it to sponsors. We can know the  faults and problems in prior and solve the problems to complete that task.

1. **Roles and responsibilities:**

The responsibility of all the tasks and deliverables related to risk is given to risk team. Risk team should get approval for all the accomplished tasks from risk manager.

1. **Budget and schedule:**

Risk management should be done every week to identify any risks in the project. There is always risk on costings ** ** of the project, as when the project starts there are bound to be changes as the project proceeds.

1. **Risk categories:**

There are different categories of risk involved such as

- People risk
- Technical risk
- Financial risk
- Market risk.

1. **Risk probabilities and impact:**

 We are going to measure the risk probabilities in terms of dollars, human resources and usage of website i.e., how are we going to affect financially maintaining all the records of employees.

1. **Revised stakeholders&#39; tolerance:**

We will be informing stakeholders about each deliverable weekly once to mitigate risks. As stakeholders are aware of every phase of project, they will be ready to accept a little amount of risk.

1. **Tracking:**

As mentioned earlier, we are going to review our project every week, which makes the risk management easy. All the lessons learned while identify and reducing the risks are going to be documented and shared using MS Word and google documents respectively.

1. **Risk documentation:**

Report the documentation as hard and soft copy to management.

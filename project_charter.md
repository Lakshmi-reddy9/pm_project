### Scope

#### Phase 1 - Conception and initiation (Module 1)

Phase 1 involves a friendly competition between muliple teams, each completing a quick (2-week, 1 module) exercise to develop a vision for the project on a given platform. In competitions, this exercise may be done in an afternoon. During Phase 1, the teams will work independently and each vision will be shared with the client.

Deliverables:

- Project charter
- Stakeholder Registry
- Mock ups
- Contract 

#### Phase 2 - Definition and planning 

During Phase 2, the best parts of each platform-specific charter will be used to create a single, consolidated charter that allows different platforms to share fundamental aspects such as the E-R diagram and sample data.

Deliverables:

- Combined project charter
- ER diagrams
- User Stories
- Provide Estimates

#### Phase 3 - Implementation of architectural prototypes 

During Phase 3, new teams will be defined to work in parallel (again in friendly competition) to build platform-specific architectural prototypes to identify any major issues with the plan.

Deliverables:

- Updated versions of all artifacts
- JIRA management system
- Working prototype deployed in each proposed platform
- Presentation of architectural prototype to client and extended team.
- Together with the client decide what platform(s) will be selected for implementation.
- Client acceptance of the plan

#### Phase 4 - System requirement specification 

Based on the results and lessons learned during the architectural prototypes, finalize the requirements to be used during the coming implementation phase.

Finalize implementation plan (including all remaining phases along with scope, schedule, and budget by phase).

Deliverables:

- Complete implementation plan for next semester.
- Suggested project organization for next semester.
- Signed acceptance by the client with comments.

### Schedule

The following general schedule will be followed:

- Phase 1 completed and presented at the end of week 2.
- Client feedback and updates completed at the end of week 2.
